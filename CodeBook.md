CodeBook for the Tidy Data Set

There are 180 rows and 68 columns.

The 180 rows are summarized per Subject and activity per subject



Columns Names

subject: there are a total of 30 subjects from whom the data was collected. Take a value between (1-30)

activity: each subject was  made to do 6 activities(walking, walking_updatairs, walking_downstairs, sitting, standing, laying)

Then there are 66 more variables that are the mean value and standard deviation value for the following variables
* timebodyaccx
* timebodyaccy
* timebodyaccz
* timegravityaccx
* timegravityaccy
* timegravityaccz
* timebodyaccjerkx
* timebodyaccjerky
* timebodyaccjerkz
* timebodygyrox
* timebodygyroy
* timebodygyroz
* timebodygyrojerkx
* timebodygyrojerky
* timebodygyrojerkz
* timebodyaccmag
* timegravityaccmag
* timebodyaccjerkmag
* timebodygyromag
* timebodygyrojerkmag
* freqbodyaccx
* freqbodyaccy
* freqbodyaccz

* freqbodyaccjerkz
* freqbodygyrox
* freqbodygyroy
* freqbodygyroz
* freqbodyaccmag
* freqbodyaccjerkmag
* freqbodygyromag
* freqbodygyrojerkmag

All acceleration(acc) signals are in the standard gravity units "g"
All angular velocity measurements are in the units radians / second.
